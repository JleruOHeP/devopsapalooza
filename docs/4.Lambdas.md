If there is a new functionality is required - I implement it as AWS Lambda.
For existing functions, code is saved to "lambdas" folder

Code is written in .net

to code locally make sure that .Net is installed (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-scripted-manual#scripted-install)
and PATH variable is updated accordingly (so dotnet command is available from anywhere):
`export PATH=$PATH:/home/mkoptelov/.dotnet/`

To add a new function:
`cd lambdas`
`dotnet new lambda.EmptyFunction --name Devopsapalooza-Subscribe`

and start coding!

Then according to docs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/csharp-package-cli.html) it should be possible to build and upload using: 
`dotnet tool lambda deploy-function Devopsapalooza-Subscribe --function-role insertCustomersRole` 

But it did not work for me.
I ran `dotnet build` from src folder and then used VS Code extension "AWS Toolkit" to upload `bin/debug` folder to my lambda

Then to use it on site - add it as script on a correct page. For example, on `layouts/index.html` there is a reference for a subscribe function
