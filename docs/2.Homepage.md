Second thing to do - make homepage look good and styled.

Steps to do:
1. Add cerulean css to static\css\, link it in head.html partial
2. Update layouts\partials\nav.html to include nav menu as per https://bootswatch.com/cerulean/ (and remove nav altogerther)
   Use `data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarColor01"` instead of `...-bs-...` for button. 
3. Update style.html from partials to be simple padding for body
5. Update layouts\index.html to be handcrafted fot the homepage. 
   With script for button!



Add some content and menu elements:
1. Update config.yaml to have correct menu items and icons
2. `hugo new developer/my-first-post.md`
3. Add \developer\single.hmtl into layouts folder to update how single posts in the developer category should look like
