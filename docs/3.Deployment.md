1. Install aws cli
2. Configure it for the correct access key for s3 bucket
3. Publish with "hugo -D"
4. Copy site to s3 using "aws s3 cp public/ s3://devopsapalooza.com/ --recursive"
(to keep the copy of code as a backup I zip the whole devopsapalooza folder and upload it to devopsapalooza-code bucket)
