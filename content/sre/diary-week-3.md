summary: "Week 3 - dev work"

This week felt nice. Sometime it is great to mostly focus on development and not architecture or plannings. Development has the fastest feedback loop. You write your code and run unit tests locally and see the results right away!

	* Refactoring of the Kotlin microservice
	* Story preparation for the next Sprint
	* Architectural meeting to discuss what security practices we want to implement to harden K8S cluster

### Tuesday
	* Prod deployment
	* Reorganize repositories between different projects and update their pipeline triggers
	* Worked on identity provider automation 

### Wednesday
	* Worked on JPA classes, Adapters and Services for a new microservice
	* Added FrontDoor routes for a new microservice

### Thursday
	* Worked on Java Mappers
	* Planned work for Systems group for the next Product Increment (5 sprints)
	* Presented Authentication mechanisms for Azure (Access Policies vs Connection Strings vs SAS tokens)

### Friday

    * Prepared for a feedback round
