summary: "What development language to pick for start"
---
I can easily imagine a situation where a student sits in front of his laptop and thinks - what language should I learn? Is it better to learn C# or Java? Or maybe focus on Go? On the other hand, for data science, it is almost always a requirement to know Python! Maybe the correct solution is to learn all of them; then I will have plenty of jobs available!

For me, this choice was a bit easier. In school, there was only one option - Pascal and then Delphi. It was more like an introduction to software development. Then in the university, it was C++, but the classes were really outdated. My first job in IT was not about development; instead, it was network administration. So when I decided to get back to programming, I was looking for a development job and was preparing myself for whatever language was required for those specific companies. 

Nowadays, I feel comfortable with a plethora of languages, and I think I can pick a new one pretty fast. It is because the basis of all of them is the same. You need to know basic algorithmic structures and understand what good and clean code is. It does not matter if you would start your journey with Node or Javascript. As far as you enjoy the language and the things you are doing - it is fine. You will learn more and more, read beautiful functions, be repulsed by your old code, and want to rewrite everything you did from scratch. It is the joy of software development!
